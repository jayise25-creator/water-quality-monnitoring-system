# 💧 Water Quality Monitoring System for Birds using IoT

An **IoT-based real-time water monitoring system** designed to protect **bird habitats and aquatic ecosystems** by continuously measuring important water quality parameters.

---

## 📌 Project Idea

Water bodies used by birds may look clean but can contain **hidden contamination** such as changes in **temperature, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS)** that are not visible to the eye.
Real-time monitoring is therefore essential to detect unsafe conditions early and protect wildlife. 

This project builds a **sensor-based monitoring system using Arduino and IoT** to provide **instant data and early warnings** for safer water environments. 

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Hidden contamination in lakes can harm birds before visible signs appear.
* Lack of **continuous real-time monitoring** delays detection of unsafe water.
* Need for a **low-cost conservation solution** to protect wildlife and ecosystems.

These issues make early detection systems extremely important.

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. **Sensors collect data**

   * Temperature sensor (DS18B20)
   * TDS sensor
   * Turbidity sensor
     All connected to an Arduino controller. 

2. **Data processing**

   * Raw analog values converted into meaningful units using calibration formulas.
   * Multiple readings averaged to improve accuracy and reduce noise. 

3. **Display & IoT monitoring**

   * Values shown on OLED/LCD screen.
   * Data can be sent via Wi-Fi for remote monitoring and early warning alerts.

## 🧪 Parameters Monitored

* Water temperature
* Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
* Turbidity

The system successfully monitors these values **in real time** and helps detect hidden contamination.
